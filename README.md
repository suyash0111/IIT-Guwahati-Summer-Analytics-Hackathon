Brief Overview: This system analyzes parking data including occupancy rates, traffic conditions, queue lengths, and geographic factors to dynamically adjust parking prices in real-time, with additional features for competitor analysis and rerouting recommendations.
Brief Overview: This system analyzes parking data including occupancy rates, traffic conditions, queue lengths, and geographic factors to dynamically adjust parking prices in real-time, with additional features for competitor analysis and rerouting recommendations.

Tech Stack: Python 3.11+, Pandas, NumPy, Bokeh for visualization, GeoPy for geographic calculations, Tkinter for file uploads, and OpenPyXL for Excel processing.

Architecture: The system follows a modular design with distinct layers for data input, processing, pricing models, real-time engine, and visualization. The Mermaid diagram shows the data flow from user upload through the three pricing models to final visualization and recommendations.

Key Features: Real-time pricing simulation, interactive file upload, geographic competitor analysis, rerouting suggestions for congested lots, and comprehensive performance analytics with interactive Bokeh visualizations.
